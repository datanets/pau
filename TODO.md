TODO
====
- store data results
- run calculations
- find percentages
- find patterns
- divide found keys by total words and add to a new list of Double(s) in found HashMap
- find total words in input file
- how to make the jump to knowing what type of POS a common POS candidate really is from data available?


Done
====
- added: find common POS candidates
- added: weights are added to new possible POS key/value entries (when a POS is found in a new data set, weight is increased... more likely to be a common POS)
- added: learnedPOS intro
- added: read in input (line by line)
